# UHM Swap Meet
<i>Trading Items with ease.</i>

# The Problem
Often times, many students and extremely poor. They live literally on top of each other, eat frozen pizzas everyday, and have just a terrible life.

# The Solution
What if there was a place they could get free stuff? Introducing UHM Swap Meet, an application that allows for the UHM community to easily interact with each other.

# Our Execution
UHM Swap Meet integrates the UH CAS login system, so users will be able to easily log in to the application without creating their own account.

Our users will have a place to create new postings and advertise their free items. Other users will be able to access a feed that shows all new postings, filtered based on what they need.

All you have to do is notify the poster that you are interested, arrange a pick-up time and location, and that's it! Enjoy your new microwave! Now you can turn your frozen pizza into a heated frozen pizza.
