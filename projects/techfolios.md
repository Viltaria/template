# Techfolios

Over the summer, I worked on Techfolios as a part of an ICS 499 class.

This experience helped me gain experience in Node.js as well as Electron and Semantic-UI.

It also helped me gain experience in working in a team. This includes F2F (Face to Face) interactions as well as using Git branches/merging properly.
