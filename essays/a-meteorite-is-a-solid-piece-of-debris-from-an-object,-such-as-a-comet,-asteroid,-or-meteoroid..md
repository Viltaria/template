Meteor is an impressive javascript framework that pre-packages everything you might need into one application. It includes various discretionary packages, and many more are available only one npm install away.

Using Meteor lets you spin up projects in no time. It lets you skip the project set-up process, and jump right into developing your application. This is beneficial since it lets you work on <strong>things that matter</strong>. Without having to configure your application, meteor provides a way for quick and easy development.

Just like Starbucks, Meteor is also unable to get your name right most of the time. 

For the most part, first time users are clueless. Without proper guidance, most new meteor users end up putting things in their non-intended place, but still have it work. Meteor ends up giving you the wrong drink, so to speak. This is bad because it rewards <strong>bad coding practices</strong>.

Meteor is very useful for some projects, but we should always use the right tool for the job. If a client wanted a static website, using meteor for that type of project might be out of scope. However, if you wanted to create a dynamic, modern, and responsive web application, look no further as Meteor is the framework for you.
