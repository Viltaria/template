Many people underestimate the power of open source. I for one, am I firm believer that if the open source community didn't exist, the software engineering field would not be as developed as it is today.

People working together is at the core what it means to be "open source". Stack Overflow is only one of the sites that promotes this kind of growth. This type of collaboration is not only is beneficial for everyone involved, it also leaves a legacy for generations to follow. This is seen by how even questions/answers that are many years old on Stack Overflow are still relevant today. 

## Asking questions the right way

Asking questions the right way is a very important skill for a software developer. Look at [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/927358/how-to-undo-the-last-commits-in-git)

This person used many of the traits found in Eric Raymond's "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way". 
First, he clearly explains his problem, in a short and easy way for the reader to understand. 
Second, he includes relevant links to things which might help current and future readers understand the context of his situation.
And third, he went back and accepted the answer that helped his particular solution.

Asking questions the right way not only gives you a timely answer, but it also helps future readers who are having the same problem understand how to fix it, since writing a good question leads to a good answer.

In this particular case, the questioner's question was answered with an answer that is easy to understand and clearly explains each step.

## Asking questions the wrong way

Many often times on Stack Overflow, you will find a post like [this](link).

This person is not asking a smart question. She/He does not clearly explain his/her problem, but instead confuses the reader as to what he/she truly means. Second, he/she includes no context as to what the environment looks like. And Third, he/she doesn't go back to the post and accept an answer, and includes no extra details as to his particular problem or if they even solved it.

This question not only wasted the time of everyone answering it, it also leads to the questioner not having his/her problem fixed. This question will also confuse other people who are having the same problem in the future.
