# A demonstration of Tries
## What
Tries are an efficient information retrieval data structure. Using tries, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length).

## Why
Tries allow you to insert and find strings in O(L) time (where L represent the length of a single word). They also allow you to find words that have a single character different, a prefix in common, a character missing, etc.
