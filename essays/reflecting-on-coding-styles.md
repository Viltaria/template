# Reflecting on Coding Styles

My experience with coding styles has always been the same throughout all of the projects I've worked on. If it works, it's fine. 

There have been so many times when people have commented on my code for being so dynamic. Sometimes I agree with them, sometimes I disagree. But at least I can always say one thing, "It works". 

Honestly, I think too many people spend too much time arguing about different coding styles. Who cares if you abide by Google's or Airbnb's coding standard, and who cares if your brackets are on the same line as your conditions or below it.

There should only be one main goal in a programmer's mind when writing his code. Does this work? They shouldn't have to worry about abiding by different coding standards and ideas until after they verify the project works.
