A couple days ago, Biki, Hawaii’s first bike sharing program launched.
I was an early admirer of this program which is available for viewing at gobiki.org. But today an email came to my attention stating the following.

As someone who is currently studying technology, I was shocked at the complete disregard for people’s privacy.
They had sent out a mass email to all of their users with the same temporary password.
This email also had all of the other affected users information in the CC header, so anyone who also received this email could log in as anyone else and view their personal information (Name, DOB, Address, Phone Number, …etc).
This apathetic approach to security makes me sad and I hope that they resolve this issue quickly and painlessly.
